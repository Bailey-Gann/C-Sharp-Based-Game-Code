# C-Sharp-Based-Game-Code
read title


Originally inspired by the game Dungeons and Dragons, and now brought up by a co-worker who has an assignment in C++, 
 I intend to generate a list of monsters with set order values, health points, and damage points.
 The program will load and ask the user for two inputs, which must match a name from the pre-determined monster list -
 which will be provided by the program as well.
 The list will continue to be displayed until the user chooses two valid inputs, and then the fight commences.
 A loop will continuously check for the health of both monsters, exiting only when one drops to 0 or fewer HP.
 Monster order will be determined by the order values coded into their stat-blocks.
 Health and damage values are set, and will not change( not in version 1, anyway).
 Monster class will store four basic properties: bool alive, double health, double damage, int order (all order values must be unique, and can be any int).
